## The Poisson Distribution

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed time interval or region of space. The mean is a known constant and outcomes are independent of previous events - Poisson processes have no memory.

## Probability Mass Function

$$\begin{aligned}& X \sim \text{ Poisson} = \frac{e^{-\lambda t}(\lambda t)^{x}}{x!}, &&x=0, 1, 2, ... \\
\text{where } &\lambda = \text{ average number of outcomes,} \\
\text{and } &t=\text{time.}\end{aligned}$$

The Poisson distribution makes a few assumption:

\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{x} is the number of times an event occurs in an interval and can take any positive value.
 \item Events occur independently, e.g. a previous occurrence has no impact on future occurrences.
 \item The mean is assumed to be constant but may have small variations.
 \item Two events cannot happen at the exact same time.
\end{itemize}
